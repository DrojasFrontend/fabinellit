                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">
                    As that summer unfolded, something began to bloom between them: nights on the sand and in the sea, movie marathons that stretched till dawn, 3am Denny’s runs, and beach hangs with mutual friends. Something light-hearted was happening—but underneath it, something else was forming too. Something neither of them expected, but both of them felt.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">
                    They started dating in 2015, when they were still just teenagers—trying to figure out who they were, and who they might become.  From Miami to LA to DC and back to Miami again, what followed was nearly a decade of growing up—sometimes side by side, sometimes stretched across time zones and city lines. There were late-night phone calls and tearful airport goodbyes, semesters apart and seasons of change. But through it all, they kept choosing each other. Quietly, insistently, fully.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">
                    What makes their love work isn’t that they’re the same—it’s that they balance each other. <br>
                    She asks the deep questions; he brings the steady answers. <br>
                    He’s the quiet strength; she’s the brilliant storm. <br>
                    He brings the energy and adventure; she brings the meaning and magic. <br>
                    He pushes her toward fun; she pulls him toward feeling. <br>
                    </p>

                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">They’ve built a love that’s real—fun, deep, and fully their own. It’s been shaped by years of growing up together, learning each other’s rhythms, and choosing to show up again and again. Their relationship is filled with meaning and momentum, laughter and late-night talks, quiet comfort and spontaneous joy. It’s not perfect, but it’s deeply felt—and grounded in a kind of trust that only time can build.</p>

                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">In December 2024, Nellit proposed in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, in a rose-covered amphitheater lit with candles and mariachis beneath the stars. Later that night, he had something even more special planned: a private dinner under the open sky, with a menu curated by a local chef to reflect both of their favorite flavors. Just the two of them, their own waiter, a starlit table, and plenty of mezcal-pepino cocktails to soften the nerves.</p>

                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">Now, nearly ten years after that first time meeting in that backyard party in Miami, they’re getting married in Cartagena—a city as rich and layered as their love. With its colonial churches, faded balconies, crashing waves, and music echoing through cobblestone streets, Cartagena holds space for history, celebration, and soul. It’s the perfect place to begin their next chapter—a place that, like them, holds both stillness and fire. Cartagena was the first corner of Colombia Fabi ever set foot in—Nellit’s country—yet it reminded her of her own: the walled city evoking the charm of Viejo San Juan, the reggaeton, the tropical pulse, the warmth of the coast. Cartagena feels like him, and it feels like her too. The coconut rice, the fried fish, the costeño music. The visits to his grandma, Lela, in nearby Barranquilla. That unforgettable New Year’s Eve when Silvestre Dangond sang by the ocean, moonlight dancing on the waves. And on another visit, something quietly beautiful unfolded: the first time Fabi’s mom tasted costeño flavors and moved to Cartagena’s rhythm—smiling freely on the sand, her joy unguarded. It felt like two families, two cultures, two stories beginning to braid themselves together. Their roots intertwined in joy.</p>

                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">It felt only right to return here—to the city where her feet first touched his land, where music and moonlight once wove their worlds together. To celebrate not just what they’ve built, but what they’re still becoming. Cartagena holds all of that. A thousand memories. A thousand beginnings. A love story still unfolding. A promise carved not only beneath the stars, but in years of showing up, of choosing, of believing in something quietly powerful and endlessly worth it.</p>

                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-5">They can’t wait to dance, laugh, and live it all out—with you at their side.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-titulo text-center fs-xl-sm-1 fs-2-md">About the Bride</h2>

                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">Born in Puerto Rico and raised in Miami, with roots in Mexico, Cuba, Spain, and Italy, Fabi is a rich tapestry of cultures, flavors, and feelings. She grew up between coastlines and countries—shaped by family traditions, late-night talks, and summers spent between Mexico City and the Caribbean. She’s deeply proud of her heritage—and it shows in her music, her food, and her heart.</p>

                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">She studied international relations and political science (just don’t expect her to debate—she’d much rather connect than convince). Now, she’s in the thick of a career pivot into medicine—a path as demanding as it is meaningful, one that draws on her deep curiosity, empathy, and love of understanding how people work.</p>

                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">Fabi lights up when she’s diving into something—health, history, human behavior—and she can get just as lost in a karaoke ballad as in a long, cozy conversation about life. People often assume she’s extroverted, but beneath the spark is a soft, sensitive soul. She notices everything: how someone speaks to a waiter, whether a dog feels safe in a room, or how her loved ones are really feeling beneath the surface.</p>

                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">She’s loyal to the bone, emotionally observant, and moved by the quiet strength of people who’ve lived through hard things. She’s equal parts old soul and firecracker, soft heart and strong will—forever seeking to learn, love, and live with intention.</p>

                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">Fabi dreams of a life filled with warmth and meaning—long walks, deep conversations, spontaneous laughter, shared meals, and quiet moments that turn into lasting memories. She wants a marriage grounded in joy, genuine connection, playful energy, and a bond that deepens through the everyday rhythms of life.</p>

                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">She loves love—the real, beautiful kind. The kind that grows with care, with commitment, and with intention. What she cherishes most is building a life that feels full—gym sessions, dancing in the kitchen, traveling to new places, learning side by side, and always being each other’s favorite person to come home to.</p>

                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-5">She believes in building a life that feels like home—and for her, that’s a little bit history, a little bit music, a lot of heart, and Nellit woven into every part of it.</p>


                    <h2 class="font-titulo text-center fs-xl-sm-1 fs-2-md">About the Groom</h2>
                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">Nellit was born in Valledupar, Colombia, but grew up between Barranquilla, Bogotá, and Miami—but it’s Barranquilla’s vibrant spirit and Miami’s energy that feel most like home. He carries the rhythm of Valledupar in his love for vallenato, the joy and color of Barranquilla’s Carnaval in his outlook, and the fast-paced, sun-soaked energy of Miami in his stride. His background blends Colombia’s Caribbean warmth with the deep-rooted pride of his Levantine heritage, creating a quiet strength shaped by culture, tradition, and heart.</p>

                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">He studied business analytics, once dreamed of being a professional soccer player, and now spends his days building meaningful projects, like his soccer league that helps local schools raise money for students in need. For Nellit, success isn’t just about achievement; it’s about purpose, impact, and showing up for others.</p>

                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">He lights up around family, fútbol, and great food—especially anything with bold flavors and cultural roots. He always knows the score of the match, the perfect playlist for a drive, or just the right moment to make you laugh. But beneath his easygoing charm is someone deeply grounded—someone who listens more than he speaks, who means what he says, and who takes care of the people he loves in steady, meaningful ways.</p>

                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">Nellit doesn’t need grand gestures to show love—it’s in the steady ways he shows up: making you laugh when you need it most, noticing the little things (especially when it comes to Fabi), and being there when it matters. He believes in building a life that feels calm, joyful, and real: soccer games and road trips, sunset walks and deep talks, loyalty and laughter. With Fabi, he’s found all of that—and more.</p>

                    <p class="fs-p-xxl letter-spacing-15 text-center">Now, Nellit’s all in on building something real—a home, a future, a family—with Fabi by his side. The backyard BBQs, the shared goals, the babies, and the dog—all of it. Everything he does now, he does for the two of them. This wedding isn’t just a celebration of love; it’s the start of that vision taking shape. A promise not just for today, but for all the beautiful days to come.</p>
